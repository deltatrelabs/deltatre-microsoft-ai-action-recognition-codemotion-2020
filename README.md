Predicting sports actions using Deep Learning at scale
============

In this repository you can find the slides for **Predicting sports actions using Deep Learning at scale** session, presented at [Codemotion Online Tech Conference 2020 (Italian edition)](https://events.codemotion.com/conferences/online/2020/online-tech-conference-italian-edition/) on November 26th, 2020.

Abstract:

In this session we'll have a look at the joined project between Deltatre and Microsoft, to build a deep learning solution for automatic detection of soccer actions, for example when players shot on the goal. We'll see how to exploit and combine multiple computer vision and deep learning techniques to productionize this pipeline at cloud scale, using Microsoft Azure platform and open-source frameworks, such as PyTorch, Tensorflow and OpenCV.
